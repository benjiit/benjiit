- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @benjiit
I am a Mechanical Engineer with a Bachelors Degree from Clemson University trying to improve the world by focusing on sustainable practices in my personal and professional life.
I enjoy the prospect of working with new technologies, such as VR and 3D printing, and getting a chance to improve them further.
I am proficient in multiple computer programming languages such as C++ and Python. I also am very well versed in design software such as SolidWorks and similar CAD.

In addition to my pursuits in the engineering field, I have begun honing my 3D design and programming skills through a Masters of Science in Digital Production Arts.
In this program, I am able to optimize the use of my free time to develop my personal and professional interests in Digital Productions.

I work very well in a team environment and thrive in a setting where finding creative and innovative solutions is a daily challenge.
