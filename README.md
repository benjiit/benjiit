ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @benjiit

I am a Mechanical Engineer with a Bachelor's Degree from Clemson University, dedicated to improving the world through sustainable practices in both my personal and professional life. I am passionate about working with emerging technologies such as VR and 3D printing and continuously seek opportunities to enhance and innovate within these fields.

Although I am proficient in multiple programming languages, including C++ and Python, I excel in using design software such as SolidWorks and other CAD tools. I have extensive experience collaborating with CAD through data management systems like PDM, PLM, Windchill, and 3DExperience.

Currently, I am advancing my 3D design and programming skills through a Master of Science in Digital Production Arts. This program allows me to effectively utilize my free time to further develop my interests in digital productions.

I excel in team environments and thrive on the challenge of finding creative and innovative solutions.
